# Stack-Overflow-Analysis

A well-known online forum where software engineers may ask questions and
exchange information is called Stack Overflow. The website features over 18 mil-
lion questions and 29 million answers, making it a useful resource for learning
about programming languages, tools, and techniques. I examine the usage of
Stack Overflow data for analytics in this essay. I specifically look into the dataâ€™s
ability to shed light on the preferences and requirements of developers as well
as the fads and trends in programming languages. I provide numerous examples
of the studies we ran using the dataset and outline the approach we used to
gather and preprocess the data. My findings offer insights into the present status
and potential future orientations of the discipline and show the value of Stack
Overflow data for addressing research issues about software development.

# Keywords 
Stack Overflow, DEA, Stack Overflow Analysis

# Methods
A range of resources, including as datasets, databases, and software tools, were employed to develop and evaluate the Stack Overflow database. BigQuery, a cloud-based data warehouse, was used to extract the Stack Overflow dataset, which was then converted to JSON format using queries and scripts. The data was shared and stored via Google Drive. Other software tools employed were SQL, a relational database management system, and Python, a computer language frequently used for data analysis. The Stack Overflow public data dump and the Stack Exchange Data Explorer were two of the datasets used. Through the use of these resources over the past few months, the data could be extracted, stored, and analyzed effectively and efficiently.
